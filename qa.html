            <div class="qa-question">What is the dress code?</div>
            <div class="qa-answer">
                <p>We ask guests to please dress in formal to cocktail attire, and to 
                   bring a masquerade mask for our subtle Phantom of the Opera theme. 
                   Following the ceremony, part of the cocktail hour and reception will be a 
                   masquerade. We request guests "dress up" by wearing their masquerade mask.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Please do not wear the Phantom mask.</strong></p>

                <p>While we adore your children, we have chosen for our wedding day to be a 21+ occasion. We hope this advance

                <p>We are hoping to have a more causal gathering the day before to have a chance to all actually hang out. If 
                we do have a relaxed get together the Friday before the wedding, we would love to have anyone under 21 
                join us if they are able.</p>
