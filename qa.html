        <div class="qa-item">
            <div class="qa-question">What is the dress code?</div>
            <div class="qa-answer">
                We ask guests to please dress in formal to cocktail attire, and to please bring a masquerade mask! Our wedding has a bit of a Phantom of the Opera theme. Following the ceremony, part of the cocktail hour and reception will be a masquerade. We request guests "dress up" by wearing a masquerade mask, after all, it is Halloween.

                <strong>Please do not wear the Phantom mask.</strong>
                If you have questions or would like guidance on what to wear, please visit our "Dress Code" page.

                While we adore your children, we have chosen for our wedding day to be a 21+ occasion. We hope this advance notice means you are still able to share our big day.

                We are hoping to have a more causal gathering the day before to have a chance to all actually hang out. If we do have a relaxed get together the the Friday before the wedding, we would love to have anyone under 21 join us if they would like to.
